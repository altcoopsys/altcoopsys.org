========== definitions ==========

will define/explain certain standards/protocols.

====== synonyms

what are synonyms?

synonyms are multiple words for one "thing"

example:

=== result ===

result = answer = response = output... all kind of the same thing. result will be used as default.

====== json DisplayServerStatusMessage from server ======

the server DisplayServerStatusMessages with a json-string containing the following:

	$result["version"] = "§§jquery-server.com_protocol1.0"; <- this marks the beginning of the message (there might be php-warnings going prior this which will be cut away = ignored by the client)
	$result["action"] = $action;
	$result["resultType"] = $resultType;
	$result["resultValue"] = $resultValue;
	$result["details"] = $details;
	$result["finishTag"] = "§§"; <- this marks the end of the message

the js-client will cut away everything prior to the first § and everything that follows the last §.

(hopefully only) leaving: {key:value,key2:value2} for further processing which contians the actual informations from the server.

so the content of a message can contain multiple § but never two §§ right after each other.

well you need to define these separators somehow.
