jquery-server.com
=================

write less, communicate more, a server for jquery. first php... then java... then c? if the concept is good and easy, why not?

philosophy: keept it as simple as possible.

if you can make things simpler / with less code - do it.

problem: it's not easy with php to write understandable code. (the code works, but is a mess... for maximal performance and security you should probably write your own werbserver+jquery-server.com-commands in c.

all relevant infos can be found under http://jquery-server.com
